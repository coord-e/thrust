# test

- full compilation support
- report diag on unsat

# fundamentals

- elaborations such as:
  - native assignment: let mut a = 1; a = 2;
  - assign twice: *m = 1; *m = 2;
  - call-assign: let m = &mut a; f(m); *m = 2;
  - insert drop when nothing happened
    - the one way to handle them, is that, to handle all &mut operations with implicit reborrow, and insert drop automatically
- std::box::Box

# features

- BinOp support e.g. Eq
- datatype support -> CheckedAdd
- UI
  - Language Server
  - nice error reporting

# fixes

- API......
- intrinsic function signatures e.g. panic
