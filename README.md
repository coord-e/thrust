# Thrust

Thrust is a refinement type checking and inference tool for Rust.

## Getting Started

- Make sure [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) is installed.
- The main binary, `thrust-rustc`, behaves like `rustc` but includes Thrust's verification.
- In the following instructions, we assume the Thrust source code is cloned locally and commands are executed within it.

Take the following Rust code (`gcd.rs`):

```rust
fn gcd(mut a: i32, mut b: i32) -> i32 {
    while a != b {
        let (l, r) = if a < b {
            (&mut a, &b)
        } else {
            (&mut b, &a)
        };
        *l -= *r;
    }
    a
}

#[thrust::callable]
fn check_gcd(a: i32, b: i32) {
    assert!(gcd(a, b) <= a);
}

fn main() {}
```

Let Thrust verify that the program is correct. Here, we use `cargo run` in the Thrust source tree to build and run `thrust-rustc`. Note that you need to disable the debug overflow assertions in rustc, as they are currently not supported in Thrust.

```console
$ cargo run -- -Adead_code -C debug-assertions=false gcd.rs && echo 'safe'
   Compiling thrust v0.1.0 (/home/coord_e/rust-refinement/thrust)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.23s
     Running `target/debug/thrust-rustc -C debug-assertions=false -Adead_code gcd.rs`
error: verification error: Unsat

error: aborting due to 1 previous error; 2 warnings emitted
```

Thrust says the program is not safe (possible to panic). In fact, we have a bug in our `gcd` function:

```diff
 fn gcd(mut a: i32, mut b: i32) -> i32 {
     while a != b {
-        let (l, r) = if a < b {
+        let (l, r) = if a > b {
             (&mut a, &b)
         } else {
             (&mut b, &a)
```

Now Thrust verifies the program is actually safe.

```console
$ cargo run -- -Adead_code -C debug-assertions=false gcd_fixed.rs && echo 'safe'
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/thrust-rustc -C debug-assertions=false -Adead_code gcd_fixed.rs`
safe
```

Integration test examples are located under `tests/ui/` and can be executed using `cargo test`. You can review these examples to understand what the current Thrust implementation can handle.

## Development

The implementation of the Thrust is largely divided into the following modules.

- `analyze`: MIR analysis. Further divided into the modules corresponding to the program units: `analyze::crate_`, `analyze::local_def`, and `analyze::basic_block`.
- `refine`: Typing environment and related implementations.
- `rty`: Refinement type primitives.
- `chc`: CHC and logic primitives, and it also implements an invocation of the underlying CHC solver.
- `annot`: Refinement type annotation parser.

The implementation generates subtyping constraints in the form of CHCs (`chc::System`). The entry point is `analyze::crate_::Analyzer::run`, followed by `analyze::local_def::Analyzer::run` and `analyze::basic_block::Analyzer::run`, while accumulating the necessary information in `analyze::Analyzer`. Once `chc::System` is collected for the entire input, it invokes an external CHC solver via the `chc::solver` module and subsequently reports the result.
